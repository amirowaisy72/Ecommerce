I am going to discuss whole system with you.
Please extract all entities from it, 
Normalize or Embed Data Based on Relationships, 
Think About Query Patterns,
Avoid Redundant Data,
Use Flexible Schemas,
Plan for Growth,
Apply indexing where needed,
Version my Schemas,
Use Mongoose Middleware, 
Document Your Schemas,
and do all necessary things to make this complex data structure very easy to work on.

Now i am going to discuss my frontend which i already designed
